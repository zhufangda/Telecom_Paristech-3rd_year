### Assignment 2
- [FYTH_VAST_part2_final.zip](FYTH_VAST_part2_final.zip) - This compressed files contains all necessary files to run the final version notebook.
- [20181202_VAST1_FYTH_3.5.ipynb](20181202_VAST1_FYTH_3.5.ipynb) -  We updated the dimensionality reduction (t-SNE and UMAP). In order to see the interactive graphics created with ipywidgets and D3, you have to  run this notebook in your computer. It just take 5 min to run all the cells in this notebook. All the huge computation have been precalculated in this version. The 2 npy are to avoid compute TSNE and UMAP( at least 30min each).  
- [20181119_VAST1_FYTH_3.2.html](http://www.zhufangda.com/20181119_VAST1_FYTH_3.2.html) - The notebook in web page version. With it, you can see our on line and make D3 interactive graph work.
- [20181124_VAST1_FYTH_3.2.ipynb](20181124_VAST1_FYTH_3.2.ipynb) - The notebook for the second assignment with interactif graphics and conclusion. In this code, we tried to add some conclusions,  and embedded all non-usefull functions into the [vast2.py](vast2.py) library.
- [vast2.py](vast2.py) - We add all necessary functions used in our projet in order to make notebook more clear. 
- [dataset_kasios.csv](dataset_kasios.csv) - Dataset Kasios
- [dataset2.csv](dataset2.csv) -  dataset with 50100 features

### Assignment 1
- [20181012_VAST1_FITH_1.ipynb](20181012_VAST1_FITH_1.ipynb) - The notebook for the first assignment. 
- [Assignment1_Report.pdf](Assignment1_Report.pdf) - The report for the first assignment
- [vast.py](vast.py) - The librairy containing some utilities functons
- [Allbirds_since2006.gif](Allbirds_since2006.gif) - The animation showing the density of all birds
- [BluePipit_since2006.gif](BluePipit_since2006.gif) - The animation showing the density for the Blue-pipit
